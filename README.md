### 📖 A little more about myself

<p></br>I was born in Itaboraí, state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, however, at the age of one, I moved to the US (Florida, to be specific) with my family. My first language, therefore, is English, and I studied there from preschool to 3rd grade, having returned to Brazil at age 9.

Since returning, I studied and graduated in Biology at UNIRIO, having focused my efforts in botanical taxonomy, but as you can see, I eventually decided to switch careers.

I had always been curious about coding in general, probably a result of my interest in technology ever since I was a child. That being said, I decided to dwelve into the subject and, since then, I have been greatly enthusiastic for my future as a programmer.

Throughout my studies and development of numerous projects, I've already much to show, and intend to hone what I already know while simultaneously expanding upon my array of knowledge. Take a look and see what I mean!  </p></br>
