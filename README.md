### 📖 A little more about myself

<h3>I was born in Itaboraí, state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, however, at the age of one, I moved to the US (Florida, to be specific) with my family. My first language, therefore, is English, and I studied there from pre-school to 3rd grade, and returned to Brazil at age 9.
  <br>

Since returning, I haven't left the state, but have moved several times between cities, including Itaboraí, Volta Redonda and Rio de Janeiro.

I studied and graduated in Biology at UNIRIO, having focused my efforts in botanical taxonomy, but as you can see, I eventually decided to switch careers.

Despite the gap between programming and biology, I had always been curious about the former, which I tend to assume is a result of my interest in technology ever since I was a child. 

That being said, I decided to dwelve into the subject. Since then, I have been greatly enthusiastic for my future as a programmer.

Although I am still new to this world, I'm excited not only to improve my skills and to gather knowledge, but also to find out what comes next, with hopes that I can somehow make a difference. </h3>
